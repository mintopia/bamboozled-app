# Bamboozled

## Introduction

Bamboozled is an interactive platform for producing live audience participation quizzes for services such as Twitch TV.

The initial aim will be to run an automated Twitch Stream in the style of 'Twitch Plays Bamboozle' where the audience chooses the answers within a certain amount of time, and the aim is to correctly answer 12 questions in order.

## Intended Uses

When complete, Bamboozled should support the following use cases:

 - Limited number of question, randomly generated trivia quizzes from a base question set. This should follow the rules of Bamboozle from Channel 4's Teletext service. Scoring would be for the entire audience.
 - Manually curated questions/trivia. Managed by a host/hosting team, they can manually specify trivia questions and take audience answers on them. Scoring would be per-person.
 - Choose your own adventure style gameplay. If you've seen The Dark Room's democracy round, you'll know what I mean.
